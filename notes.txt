Current process:

get("/file-manager)
get folders from database, including the file children
pass the folders into the locals for the "file-manager" render

How can I add a delete button?

I need to run fs.unlink(filepath)

Add to the ejs, a button that submits a post
request to delete, and passes the filepath in
as a parameter
